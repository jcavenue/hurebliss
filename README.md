## How To Install

This web-app is an installable PWA (progressive web app), meaning you install it via your device's web browser.

This is important, because it means that even if device app stores (like Apple's App Store or Google's Google Play Store) refuse to allow this app, or governments force them to block it, as long as you have an open internet connection, you can always install this application free of any governmental control.

1. Visit `https://Hurebliss.com` in a browser on your device.

    - For iOS devices, Safari browser offers the best installable PWA experience, so that's strongly recommended.

    - For all other devices (Android, Windows, etc), Chrome browser offers the best installable PWA experience, so that's strongly recommended.

2. For iOS, click the "share" button in Safari's bottom toolbar, then scroll to find "Add to homescreen". Follow the prompts to install the app. Once installed, close the Safari tab and use the app from your homescreen / app-drawer.

3. For Android (using Chrome), click the `Install` button in the banner and follow the prompts. Once installed, close the Chrome tab and use the app from your homescreen / app-drawer.

4. For any other device (again, using Chrome), click the settings icon (three dots) near the top address bar, then select the menu option that says `Install HureBliss`.
