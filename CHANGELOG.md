In order to make all changelogs easier to use and read the following changes should be noted in the same manner and grouped together. This will hopefully create a standard that all can use and benefit from in the future. They are, in alphabetical order;

- Added – For any new features that have been added since the last version was released

- Changed – To note any changes to the software’s existing functionality

- Deprecated – To note any features that were once stable but are no longer and have thus been removed

- Fixed – Any bugs or errors that have been fixed should be so noted

- Removed – This notes any features that have been deleted and removed from the software

- Security – This acts as an invitation to users who want to upgrade and avoid any software vulnerabilities
